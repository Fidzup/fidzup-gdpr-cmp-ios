 Delegate of CMPConsentManager.

     Called when the consent manager found a reason to display the Consent Tool UI. The publisher should display
     the consent tool as soon as possible.
     
     Note: this delegate will never be called if 'showConsentToolWhenLimitedAdTracking=false' is used during the CMPConsentManager
     configuration and if the user has enabled 'Limited Ad Tracking' in its iOS preferences. In this case, a consent string without
     any consent will be automatically generated and stored.
     
     - Parameters:
        - consentManager: The consent manager instance.
        - vendorList: The vendor list you should ask consent for.
